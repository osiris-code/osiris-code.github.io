## Submit feature enhancements

We are always looking for new ideas! Before you start writing code you should reach out to the developers using the mailing list. Other developers may already be working on similar ideas and/or may be able to help you with your new idea. Also, check the code contributions section below.

## Code contributions

All contributions are submitted as pull requests on our [development GitHub repository](https://github.com/golp-ist/osiris/). To be able to contribute to the code you need to [join the OSIRIS project](/team). This will give access to the development repository and the OSIRIS developer community.
